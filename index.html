           <strong>  The Cabinet had approved scaling-up of solar power target from 20,000 MW of Grid 
Connected Solar power Projects to 1,00,000 MW by 2022. </strong> <br>
While Large Scale Solar power generation projects are being installed to achieve the ambitious 
target of 100 GW of Solar Power generation by 2022, it has been planned to simultaneously 
develop decentralized Solar energy and other renewable energy generation Plants of capacity 
up to 2 MW which could be connected directly to existing 33/11 kV or 66/11 kV or 110/11 kV 
sub-stations of Distribution Company, thus saving in transmission system requirement apart 
from T&D losses. Such plants near these sub-stations may be developed, preferably by farmers, 
giving them an opportunity to increase their income by utilising their barren and uncultivable 
land for solar or other renewable energy based power plants. Cultivable land may also be used 
if the Solar plants are set up on stilts where crops can be grown below the stilts and sell RE
power to DISCOMs. <br> <br>
Besides, developing decentralized renewable power, it is planned to replace Agriculture Diesel 
pumps with Solar Water pumps and Solarise Grid connected Agriculture pumps. At present, 
over 30 million agricultural pumps are installed in India, out of which nearly 10 million pumps 
are diesel based. The Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) are not in a position to energize 
these pumps through grid connection as seen from the long waiting lists with such Distribution 
Companies. Hence there is a need to provide energy to these pumps through solar energy. Also, 
over 20 million grid-connected agriculture water pumps installed in the country consume more 
than 17 percent of total annual electricity consumption of the country. Solarization of the same 
can reduce dependence of these pumps on conventional sources of energy supplied by 
DISCOMs and thus reducing their burden of subsidy on agriculture consumption of Electricity. 
This will also provide additional source of income to farmers who will be in a position to sell 
the surplus power to DISCOMs.
